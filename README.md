1. Sir William Pettys Quantulumcunque concerning Money, 1682.

    _ QUESTIONS.
Qu. 1. Whether the old unequal Money ought to be new Coined, and brought to an equality?Answ. It ought: Because Money made of Gold and Silver is the best Rule of Commerce, and must therefoQu. 2. At whose Charge?Answ. At the States Charge, as now it is: Because the Owner was no cause of its Inequality, but the Qu. 3. Of what weight and fineness ought the new Shiling to be?Answ. Of the same with the other present new Money, and which the old was of, when it was new: BecauQu. 4. Suppose 20s. of old Money may make but 18s. of new, who shall bear the loss of the two shilliAnsw. Not the States: Because men would clip their own Money: But the owner himself must bear the loQu. 5. After this Reformation of Coin, Will more Silver be carried out of England, suppose into the Answ. Somewhat more: But none to the Damage of England, Eo Nomine; but rather to its Profit: BecauseQu. 6. Whereas the Merchant carries Scarlet and Silver to the Indies, will he not now carry only theAnsw. The Merchant will buy as much Scarlet as he can for 100 new Shillings, and then consider whethQu. 7. But will not England be impoverished by Merchants carrying out the said 100 Shillings?Answ. No, if he brings home for them as much Silk as will yield above 100 Shillings (perhaps 200 ShiQu. 8. But if the new Shilling were but ¾ths of the weight as formerly, then the Merchant would not Answ. The Merchant would Export then, just as before; Only he will give but ¾ so much Pepper, or othQu. 9. If a Shilling was by new Coinage reduced to ¾ of its present weight, should we not thereby haAns. You would indeed have ⅓ part more of the new christned Shillings; but not an Ounce more of SilvQu. 10. Cannot Authority Command that men should give as much Commodity for the new retrencht Money,Answ. Then the effect of such Authority would also be to take away ⅓ of all mens Goods, which are CoQu. 11. Whereas you suppose retrenching ¼ in the new Coinage; Suppose it was but 1/10, how would theAnsw. Just the same: For Magis et minus non mutant speciem: But it were better you supposed that oneQu. 12. Will not some men, having occasions to buy Commodities in Forreign Parts, carry out all MoneAnsw. If some English Merchants should be so improvident, yet the Forreign Merchants would buy up suQu. 13. Why is not our old worn unequal Money new Coined and equallized?Answ. There may be many weak Reasons for it; But the only good one which I know, is, that bad and unQu. 14. Why hath Money been raised, or retrencht, or imbased by many wise States, and so often?Answ. When any State doth these things, they are like Bankrupt Merchants, who Compound for their DebQu. 15. It is then the Honour of England that no such Tricks have been practiced, though in the greaAnsw. It hath been their Wisdom, and consequently their Honour to keep up a Rule and Measure of TradQu. 16. But is there no Case wherein Money may be justly and honourably raised?Answ. Yes, in order to Regulation and Equalizing of Species of Coins; As when two Species of one WeiQu. 17. What do you think of the rising or falling of the Price of Lands, from this following InstanAnsw. It looks like a Demonstration that it is: Yet if Gold be not Money, but a Commodity next like Qu. 18. What is the difference between retrenching or raising of Money, and imbasing the Metal of thAnsw. The first is the better of the two, if such Mixture be of no use in other things: For if 20s. Qu. 19. What do you object against small Silver Money; as against Single Pence, Two Pences, &c.?Answ. That the Coinage of small Pieces would be very chargeable, and the Pieces themselves apt to beQu. 20. What do you say of Money made wholly of base Metal, such as Farthings, &c.?Answ. That the want of Materials ought to be made up by the fineness of Coinage, to very near the inQu. 21. Which is best, Copper or Tin, for this purpose?Answ. Copper: Because it is capable of the most imitable and durable Coinage: though the Copper be FQu. 22. This Doctrine may extend to a free exportation of Money and Bullion, which is against our LaAnsw. Perhaps they are against the Laws of Nature, and also impracticable: For we see that the CountQu. 23. Is not a Country the poorer for having less Money?Answ. Not always: For as the most thriving Men keep little or no Money by them, but turn and wind itQu. 24. May a Nation, suppose England, have too much Money?Answ. Yes: As a particular Merchant may have too much Money, I mean coined Money, by him.Qu. 25. Is there any way to know how much Money is sufficient for any Nation?Answ. I think it may pretty well be guessed at; viz. I think that so much Money as will pay half a YQu. 26. What Remedy is there if we have too little Money?Answ. We must erect a Bank, which well computed, doth almost double the Effect of our coined Money: Qu. 27. What if we have too much Coin?Answ. We may melt down the heaviest, and turn it into the Splendor of Plate, in Vessels or Utensils Qu. 28. What is Interest or Use-Money?Answ. A Reward for forbearing the use of your own Money for a Term of Time agreed upon, whatsoever nQu. 29. What is Exchange?Answ. Local Interest, or a Reward given for having your Money at such a Place where you most need thQu. 30. What is the Trade of a Banker?Answ. Buying and selling of Interest and Exchange: Who is honest only upon the Penalty of losing a bQu. 31. You were speaking of base Money and Farthings, which are generally below the intrinsick ValuAnsw. I think there is: viz. Allowing about 12d. in Farthings to every Family: So as if there be a MQu. 32. What do you think of our Laws for limiting Interest?Answ. The same as of limiting the Exportation of Money, and there may be as well Laws for limiting E
